## About The Project

This project is a hands-on exercise in building a modern webpage from the ground up using React. The goal was to take a classic e-commerce layout and rebuild it with modern, responsive techniques. The site is designed to be fully functional and visually appealing on all devices, from small mobile phones to large desktop screens.

### Key Features

* **Mobile-First Responsive Design:** Styled for mobile first, then scales up to desktop using CSS Flexbox and Media Queries.
* **Component-Based Architecture:** The UI is broken down into logical, reusable React components (`Header`, `Hero`, `Featured`, etc.).
* **Interactive UI with State:**
    * A collapsible "hamburger" menu for mobile navigation, managed with React's `useState` hook.
    * An interactive image gallery in the Hero section where clicking a category updates the displayed image.
* **CSS Animations:**
    * A seamless, infinitely scrolling promotional text banner created with CSS Keyframe animations.
    * Smooth transitions and hover effects on cards and buttons for an enhanced user experience.
